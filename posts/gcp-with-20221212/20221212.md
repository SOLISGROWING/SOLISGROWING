## Storage 복습

### Cloud Storage

1. Standard Storage
2. Nearline Storage
3. Coldline Storage
4. Archive Storage



#### Standard Storage

- Hot data 
- frequently access data



#### Nearline Storage

- 자주 엑세스 하지 않는 데이터
- Once per month



#### Coldline Storage

- 자주 엑세스 하지 않는 데이터
- Nearline Storage 와 비교할 때 읽기 또는 수정을 위한 것이다.



#### Archive Storage

- 백업 및 재해복구 용
- Once a year



### Cloud Spanner

-  완전히 관리되는 관계형 디비
- 수평으로 확장가능
- 고가용성 서비스에 적합
- 많은 수의 입출력 서비스에 적합
- 한마디로 말해 글로벌 서비스에 적합?



### Firestore

- Flexible

- Horizontally scalable

- Nosql cloud db

- Retrieve individual documents

- Retrive all the documents in a collection

- Can include multiple, chained filters

- Can combine filtering and sorting options

- Indexed by default

  ### 

### Cloud Bigtable

- Google’s NoSQL Big data database service
- Cloud Bigtable can interact with other Google Cloud services and third-parth clients






### Correction Note

 - Which database service can scale to higher database size?
   - Cloud Spanner
 - You manufacture devices with sensors and need to stream huge amounts of data from these devices to a storage option in the cloud. Which storage option  is the best choice for your application?
   - Bigtable
 - Your application needs to store data with strong transactional consistency, and you want seamless scaling up. Which storage option is the best choice for your application?
   - Cloud Spanner



## Container



### App Engine

- Access to programming serices to write your code
- Seamless, independent and rapid scaling
- No fine-tuning the underlying architecture to save cost



### Kubernetes

- A Pod is a small unit



### GKE  

- Google Cloud’s load-balancing for Compute Engine instances 
- Node pools to designate subsets of nodes within a cluster
- Automatic scaling of your cluster’s  node instance count
- Automatic upgrades for your cluster’s node software
- Node auto-repair to maintain node health and availability
- Logging and monitoring with Google Cloud’s operations suite



### Anthos
- A hybrid and multi-cloud solution
- Framework rests on Kubernetes and GKE On-Prem
- Provides a rich set of tools for monitoring and maintenance
  


### GCP
- Virtual Machines
- Networks
- Storage
- Containers

### App Engine
- App Engine is a fully managed, serverless platform for developing and hosting web applications at scale 

### Built-in services and APIs -> App Engine 이 제공하는 것들
- NoSQL datastores
- Health checks
- MemcACHE
- Application logging
- Load balancing
- User authentication API

### Each SDK includes
- APIs and libraries
- Sandbox environment
- Deployment tools



** The SDK manages your applicaiton locally, and the Google Cloud Console manages your application in production **
